Participants will benefit from concrete examples and best practices in ocean science to deliver “the science we need for the ocean we want”.A key outcome of the 2024 UN Ocean Decade Conference will be the publication of a set of white papers related to the 10 Decade Challenges, that will identify future priorities for the Ocean Decade to generate the knowledge needed for science-based solutions related to global challenges, such as climate change, food security, biodiversity conservation, sustainable ocean economy, pollution and natural hazards.Read more <https://oceandecade.org/news/barcelona-to-host-2024-un-ocean-decade-conference/>",

A central theme will be the development of best practices and new technologies for biodiversity observations and monitoring to support transformative policy and conservation action.The conference will offer a venue for sharing and exchanging scientific and traditional knowledge related to biodiversity change, from genes to ecosystems; the associated contributions to people, across all sectors of society; and its conservation, sustainable use and shared benefits.Visit website <https://geobon.org/geo-bon-global-conference-monitoring-biodiversity-for-action/>",

          "title": "European Conference on Ecological Modelling",
          "description": "In a world where biodiversity and ecosystem services are at high risk, business as usual is no longer possible. Transformation of how societies deal with natural resources is much needed, but requires a better understanding of how ecological and social-ecological systems respond to change and human intervention. Ecological Modelling thus needs to aim at predicting the response to change and to address multiple scales in time, space and organization that are relevant for management.The 9th European Conference on Ecological Modelling, ECEM 2023, welcomes contributions that directly or indirectly support transformation. This includes strategies and models that focus on improving one or more of the following aspects: representation of response mechanisms, multi-criteria model evaluation, model-data fusion, sensitivity and robustness analyses, upscaling and transferability to new regions, link to management scenarios, social-ecological systems, transparency and reproducibility, implementation and testing of theories and concepts, and multi-modelling synthesis. In general, any contribution advancing ecological modelling is welcome.The ECEM 2023 continues a series of conferences launched by the European chapter of ISEM, the International Society for Ecological Modelling. ISEM promotes the international exchange of ideas, scientific results, and general knowledge in the areas of systems’ analysis and simulations in ecology and application of ecological modelling for natural resource management.Visit website <https://ecem23.eu/>",
