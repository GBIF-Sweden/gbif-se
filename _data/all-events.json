    "description": "In a world where biodiversity and ecosystem services are at high risk, business as usual is no longer possible. Transformation of how societies deal with natural resources is much needed, but requires a better understanding of how ecological and social-ecological systems respond to change and human intervention. Ecological Modelling thus needs to aim at predicting the response to change and to address multiple scales in time, space and organization that are relevant for management.<br class=\"mb-4\">The 9th European Conference on Ecological Modelling, ECEM 2023, welcomes contributions that directly or indirectly support transformation. This includes strategies and models that focus on improving one or more of the following aspects: representation of response mechanisms, multi-criteria model evaluation, model-data fusion, sensitivity and robustness analyses, upscaling and transferability to new regions, link to management scenarios, social-ecological systems, transparency and reproducibility, implementation and testing of theories and concepts, and multi-modelling synthesis. In general, any contribution advancing ecological modelling is welcome.<br class=\"mb-4\">The ECEM 2023 continues a series of conferences launched by the European chapter of ISEM, the International Society for Ecological Modelling. ISEM promotes the international exchange of ideas, scientific results, and general knowledge in the areas of systems’ analysis and simulations in ecology and application of ecological modelling for natural resource management.<br class=\"mb-4\">Visit website <https://ecem23.eu/>",

The field of ecology has much to offer in addressing pressing ecological problems at all scales.

We hope all participants will become trainers or mentors for future workshops.<br class=\"mb-4\">If we receive over 30 applications to participate in the training, we will select participants based on the following criteria (not in specific order):<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Applicants that have already identified dataset(s) that they intend to publish and have cleared licensing requirements;  * Applicants that represent data holding institutions planning to publish data;  * Applicants that have plans to hold replication workshops;  * Applicants that intend to become mentors to support future workshops (advanced badge needed); The selection process will also consider geographic and thematic balance in the workshop participants.<br class=\"mb-4\">The application will close at 23:59 UTC on the 7th of July 2023.<br class=\"mb-4\">The result will be announced by the end of the 14th July 2023.<br class=\"mb-4\"> Apply here <https://forms.gle/6VtQeu9tTtwW6DUNA> ",

Data sharing with GBIF has potential to make a substantial contribution to global science and nature data availability. EBRD clients and consultants will be crucial to this new effort, and can enhance their reputation and impact via their participation.<br class=\"mb-4\">The primary audience for this webinar is EBRD clients and consultants who conduct biodiversity impact assessments for projects financed by the Bank. However, others who are considering a similar biodiversity data sharing approach or who simply want to learn more about using the GBIF platform may also find the content beneficial.<br class=\"mb-4\">The upcoming webinar will go over the practical steps of biodiversity data sharing with GBIF, including the types of data that can be published through the platform, the process of becoming a GBIF data publisher, where to find support for data publishing, and a live demonstration of the data upload process using theIntegrated Publishing Toolkit <> (IPT).<br class=\"mb-4\">Representatives from relevant GBIF country nodes will be present to answer common questions and make first-hand connections.

    "description": "<br class=\"mb-4\">Desde el 2013, cada 3 de marzo, se celebra el Día Mundial de la Vida Silvestre con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el incalculable valor de la fauna y flora silvestres para la naturaleza y el bienestar humano, la urgente necesidad de combatir los delitos contra el medioambiente y la disminución de especies a causa de las actividades humanas, lo que acarrea consecuencias negativas de gran alcance tanto en el ámbito económico, medioambiental y social. En 2024, esta fecha propone explorar la innovación digital y destacar cómo las tecnologías y los servicios digitales de conservación pueden impulsar la conservación de la vida silvestre, el comercio sostenible y legal de la vida silvestre y la coexistencia entre los seres humanos y la vida silvestre, ahora y para las generaciones futuras en un mundo cada vez más conectado. En este sentido, el Ministerio del Ambiente, Agua y Transición Ecológica de Ecuador (MAATE) en coordinación con Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), convocan al webinar \"Conectividad Digital para la Conservación de la Biodiversidad\", en el que participarán cuatro panelistas, usuarios de aplicaciones tecnológicas, quienes compartirán sus experiencias de uso y manejo de estas herramientas digitales enfocadas en la conservación de la naturaleza. Esta actividad es posible en el marco de los proyectos “Paisaje Jaguar” financiado por el Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (GEF), en alianza con el Programa Mundial de la Vida Silvestre (GWP), del Banco Mundial, y “Conservando Juntos” implementado en alianza con la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID).<br class=\"mb-4\"> Register <https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMkdu-gqj4jG9VZ5C-0hJ2UawIKyhItCtcB#/registration>",
