    "description": "In a world where biodiversity and ecosystem services are at high risk, business as usual is no longer possible. Transformation of how societies deal with natural resources is much needed, but requires a better understanding of how ecological and social-ecological systems respond to change and human intervention. Ecological Modelling thus needs to aim at predicting the response to change and to address multiple scales in time, space and organization that are relevant for management.<br class=\"mb-4\">The 9th European Conference on Ecological Modelling, ECEM 2023, welcomes contributions that directly or indirectly support transformation. This includes strategies and models that focus on improving one or more of the following aspects: representation of response mechanisms, multi-criteria model evaluation, model-data fusion, sensitivity and robustness analyses, upscaling and transferability to new regions, link to management scenarios, social-ecological systems, transparency and reproducibility, implementation and testing of theories and concepts, and multi-modelling synthesis. In general, any contribution advancing ecological modelling is welcome.<br class=\"mb-4\">The ECEM 2023 continues a series of conferences launched by the European chapter of ISEM, the International Society for Ecological Modelling. ISEM promotes the international exchange of ideas, scientific results, and general knowledge in the areas of systems’ analysis and simulations in ecology and application of ecological modelling for natural resource management.<br class=\"mb-4\">Visit website <https://ecem23.eu/>",

The field of ecology has much to offer in addressing pressing ecological problems at all scales.

Data sharing with GBIF has potential to make a substantial contribution to global science and nature data availability. EBRD clients and consultants will be crucial to this new effort, and can enhance their reputation and impact via their participation.<br class=\"mb-4\">The primary audience for this webinar is EBRD clients and consultants who conduct biodiversity impact assessments for projects financed by the Bank. However, others who are considering a similar biodiversity data sharing approach or who simply want to learn more about using the GBIF platform may also find the content beneficial.<br class=\"mb-4\">The upcoming webinar will go over the practical steps of biodiversity data sharing with GBIF, including the types of data that can be published through the platform, the process of becoming a GBIF data publisher, where to find support for data publishing, and a live demonstration of the data upload process using theIntegrated Publishing Toolkit <> (IPT).<br class=\"mb-4\">Representatives from relevant GBIF country nodes will be present to answer common questions and make first-hand connections. The full agenda is noted below. This event is part ofData4Nature <>, a sub-initiative by GBIF to encourage international financial institutions to share biodiversity data generated during project impact assessments.<br class=\"mb-4\"> Register <https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/946c3ed9-6c1a-4be9-a9ae-f34dce9d7642@172f4752-6874-4876-bad5-e6d61f991171><br class=\"mb-4\">We encourage you to review the EBRD's GBIF data upload guidance <https://www.ebrd.com/documents/environment/technical-guidance-for-ebrd-clients-on-uploading-biodiversity-data-to-the-global-biodiversity-information-facility-.pdf>, which is the cornerstone of the Bank’s new data sharing initiative and will provide the focus for the webinar.<br class=\"mb-4\">Agenda<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Opening: Recap of EBRD’s GBIF data sharing initiative  * What is GBIF and what kinds of data can be published on GBIF?  * How to become a GBIF data publisher?  * Data publishing on the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)—an introduction and live demo  * Benefits of becoming a data publisher  * Q&A and closing Email questions, comments or feedback to Marshall Geck <> or Chenxi Zhu <>",

This means that publishers sometimes share a taxon name that is changed when appearing on GBIF.org. For example, a beetle record appears as a butterfly record, or the authorship is changed. We will show examples of how the taxonomy is changed, how to investigate where the source of the change comes from, and how you can provide feedback directly to the source or GBIF helpdesk.<br class=\"mb-4\"> Register for the event <https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0tdeiorDsoGdWvwy7Qsl5PGnghya-4VDft#/registration><br class=\"mb-4\">We will be happy to answer any question relating or not to the topic and welcome your input on some of the stranger things you have had to deal with a node staff.

Data quality is one of the most important aspects that determines the potential use of a dataset. This quality is determined by multiple factors that integrate the information production and processing chain, from the initial registration or capture to the final use and interpretation. The quality of biodiversity data is also associated with its various dimensions, from taxonomy to spatial information, metadata, storage and publication.<br class=\"mb-4\">The course covers the following topics:<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Principles for data quality  * Tools and protocols for data quality  * OpenRefine  * Quality of taxonomic and spatial data  Read more <https://www.gbif.pt/node/621> ",
