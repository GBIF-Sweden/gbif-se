    "description": "In a world where biodiversity and ecosystem services are at high risk, business as usual is no longer possible. Transformation of how societies deal with natural resources is much needed, but requires a better understanding of how ecological and social-ecological systems respond to change and human intervention. Ecological Modelling thus needs to aim at predicting the response to change and to address multiple scales in time, space and organization that are relevant for management.<br class=\"mb-4\">The 9th European Conference on Ecological Modelling, ECEM 2023, welcomes contributions that directly or indirectly support transformation. This includes strategies and models that focus on improving one or more of the following aspects: representation of response mechanisms, multi-criteria model evaluation, model-data fusion, sensitivity and robustness analyses, upscaling and transferability to new regions, link to management scenarios, social-ecological systems, transparency and reproducibility, implementation and testing of theories and concepts, and multi-modelling synthesis. In general, any contribution advancing ecological modelling is welcome.<br class=\"mb-4\">The ECEM 2023 continues a series of conferences launched by the European chapter of ISEM, the International Society for Ecological Modelling. ISEM promotes the international exchange of ideas, scientific results, and general knowledge in the areas of systems’ analysis and simulations in ecology and application of ecological modelling for natural resource management.<br class=\"mb-4\">Visit website <https://ecem23.eu/>",

The field of ecology has much to offer in addressing pressing ecological problems at all scales.

We hope all participants will become trainers or mentors for future workshops.<br class=\"mb-4\">If we receive over 30 applications to participate in the training, we will select participants based on the following criteria (not in specific order):<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Applicants that have already identified dataset(s) that they intend to publish and have cleared licensing requirements;  * Applicants that represent data holding institutions planning to publish data;  * Applicants that have plans to hold replication workshops;  * Applicants that intend to become mentors to support future workshops (advanced badge needed); The selection process will also consider geographic and thematic balance in the workshop participants.<br class=\"mb-4\">The application will close at 23:59 UTC on the 7th of July 2023.<br class=\"mb-4\">The result will be announced by the end of the 14th July 2023.<br class=\"mb-4\"> Apply here <https://forms.gle/6VtQeu9tTtwW6DUNA> ",
