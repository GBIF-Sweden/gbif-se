    "description": "<br class=\"mb-4\">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development <https://www.ebrd.com> (EBRD) is seeking to improve its biodiversity data disclosure practices by sharing biodiversity data generated through EBRD-financed projects with GBIF, the world’s largest open source repository of biodiversity data. Data sharing with GBIF has potential to make a substantial contribution to global science and nature data availability. EBRD clients and consultants will be crucial to this new effort, and can enhance their reputation and impact via their participation.<br class=\"mb-4\">The primary audience for this webinar is EBRD clients and consultants who conduct biodiversity impact assessments for projects financed by the Bank. However, others who are considering a similar biodiversity data sharing approach or who simply want to learn more about using the GBIF platform may also find the content beneficial.<br class=\"mb-4\">The upcoming webinar will go over the practical steps of biodiversity data sharing with GBIF, including the types of data that can be published through the platform, the process of becoming a GBIF data publisher, where to find support for data publishing, and a live demonstration of the data upload process using theIntegrated Publishing Toolkit <> (IPT).<br class=\"mb-4\">Representatives from relevant GBIF country nodes will be present to answer common questions and make first-hand connections. The full agenda is noted below. This event is part ofData4Nature <>, a sub-initiative by GBIF to encourage international financial institutions to share biodiversity data generated during project impact assessments.<br class=\"mb-4\"> Register <https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/946c3ed9-6c1a-4be9-a9ae-f34dce9d7642@172f4752-6874-4876-bad5-e6d61f991171><br class=\"mb-4\">We encourage you to review the EBRD's GBIF data upload guidance <https://www.ebrd.com/documents/environment/technical-guidance-for-ebrd-clients-on-uploading-biodiversity-data-to-the-global-biodiversity-information-facility-.pdf>, which is the cornerstone of the Bank’s new data sharing initiative and will provide the focus for the webinar.<br class=\"mb-4\">Agenda<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Opening: Recap of EBRD’s GBIF data sharing initiative  * What is GBIF and what kinds of data can be published on GBIF?  * How to become a GBIF data publisher?  * Data publishing on the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)—an introduction and live demo  * Benefits of becoming a data publisher  * Q&A and closing Email questions, comments or feedback to Marshall Geck <> or Chenxi Zhu <>",

    "description": "<br class=\"mb-4\">Desde el 2013, cada 3 de marzo, se celebra el Día Mundial de la Vida Silvestre con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el incalculable valor de la fauna y flora silvestres para la naturaleza y el bienestar humano, la urgente necesidad de combatir los delitos contra el medioambiente y la disminución de especies a causa de las actividades humanas, lo que acarrea consecuencias negativas de gran alcance tanto en el ámbito económico, medioambiental y social. En 2024, esta fecha propone explorar la innovación digital y destacar cómo las tecnologías y los servicios digitales de conservación pueden impulsar la conservación de la vida silvestre, el comercio sostenible y legal de la vida silvestre y la coexistencia entre los seres humanos y la vida silvestre, ahora y para las generaciones futuras en un mundo cada vez más conectado. En este sentido, el Ministerio del Ambiente, Agua y Transición Ecológica de Ecuador (MAATE) en coordinación con Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), convocan al webinar \"Conectividad Digital para la Conservación de la Biodiversidad\", en el que participarán cuatro panelistas, usuarios de aplicaciones tecnológicas, quienes compartirán sus experiencias de uso y manejo de estas herramientas digitales enfocadas en la conservación de la naturaleza. Esta actividad es posible en el marco de los proyectos “Paisaje Jaguar” financiado por el Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (GEF), en alianza con el Programa Mundial de la Vida Silvestre (GWP), del Banco Mundial, y “Conservando Juntos” implementado en alianza con la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID).<br class=\"mb-4\"> Register <https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMkdu-gqj4jG9VZ5C-0hJ2UawIKyhItCtcB#/registration>",

In this way, the members will demonstrate how they are complementing nodes to effectively execute the implementation plan.<br class=\"mb-4\">The webinar will also be an opportunity for the node managers to plan for the upcoming joint meeting of the African nodes and launch of the next phase of theBID programme <https://www.gbif.org/programme/82243/bid-biodiversity-information-for-development>.<br class=\"mb-4\">For any further information contact the Africa regional support team <mailto:africa_support@gbif.org>.<br class=\"mb-4\">Agenda<br class=\"mb-4\">| Topic | Speaker | | ----- | ------------------------------------------ | |Welcome address and introduction to: (i) the regional/sub-regional webinar series (ii) Roadmap towards the regional nodes meeting & Launch of the second phase of BID programme |Jean Paul Kubwimana <https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?personId=4072&group=nodesCommittee>Chairperson, regional nodes committee (Africa) (10 minutes)| | Activities of the regional support team: technical and help desk support |Tsiky Rabetrano <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1114-956X> regional support team  (15 minutes) | |Activities of the regional support team: collection mobilization for the Global Registry of Scientific Collections(GRSciColl) <https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/>|Laban Musinguzi <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7915-3218> regional support team  (10 minutes)| | Discussion & questions | (20 minutes)| | Way forward for regional nodes meeting and subsequent webinars|Jean Paul Kubwimana <https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?personId=4072&group=nodesCommittee>Chairperson, regional nodes committee (Africa) (5 minutes)|<br class=\"mb-4\">Time: 3:00 PM in Central Africa and 4:00 PM in East Africa<br class=\"mb-4\"> Attend the event <https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89768083406?pwd=RFIzemR5YnJXVFNweXZiVWZwRDdmZz09> ",

While efforts are made to provide materials in other languages, instruction/videos will be in English. Due to limited training resources, we have 20 seats available for this workshop. If we received more registrations, we will prioritise:<br class=\"mb-4\"> * Instructors who have running curricula ready to incorporate GBIF data use materials;  * Individuals who have published or involved in publishing data through GBIF, thus equipped essential knowledge of the GBIF data chain;  * Individuals who can commit time to disseminate the knowledge learned in the workshop with partners and collaborators in your project by adapting the biodiversity data use training materials to specific contexts and languages while maintaining their instructional value.

The Graduate Researchers Award (formerly Young Researchers Award) is an annual scholarship programme that promotes and encourages innovation in biodiversity-related research using data shared through the GBIF network. Since bestowing its first awards in 2010, the programme has recognized outstanding achievements in original biodiversity research by more than two dozen Master’s and PhD students around the world.<br class=\"mb-4\">2025 Graduate Researcher Award recipients<br class=\"mb-4\">PhD student Kumdet Panshak Solomon <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0349-4213> of University of Jos in Nigeria presents research which advances biodiversity informatics and conservation in West Africa by leveraging GBIF-mediated data collected through BirdPlus, a mobile app developed with the Nigerian Bird Atlas Project (NiBAP). Designed to increase citizen science participation and data representation from the Global South, BirdPlus expands coverage of underrepresented bird species in Nigeria through a multilingual, user-friendly and offline-capable platform.<br class=\"mb-4\">Master's student Esteban Marentes Herrera <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5090-6973> from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia presents research focuses on using machine learning models to predict beetle species diversity across Colombia’s Antioquia province. Despite Colombia being a megadiverse country, current species estimates—particularly for arthropods—are underrepresented in data records. His model integrates occurrence data and curated checklists from GBIF with habitat and environmental variables from public repositories to provide a more comprehensive estimate of beetle diversity in the region.<br class=\"mb-4\">This event will be recorded and the recording made available in the week after the event.
