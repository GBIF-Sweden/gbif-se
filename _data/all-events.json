    "title": "European Conference on Ecological Modelling",
    "description": "In a world where biodiversity and ecosystem services are at high risk, business as usual is no longer possible. Transformation of how societies deal with natural resources is much needed, but requires a better understanding of how ecological and social-ecological systems respond to change and human intervention. Ecological Modelling thus needs to aim at predicting the response to change and to address multiple scales in time, space and organization that are relevant for management.<br class=\"mb-4\">The 9th European Conference on Ecological Modelling, ECEM 2023, welcomes contributions that directly or indirectly support transformation. This includes strategies and models that focus on improving one or more of the following aspects: representation of response mechanisms, multi-criteria model evaluation, model-data fusion, sensitivity and robustness analyses, upscaling and transferability to new regions, link to management scenarios, social-ecological systems, transparency and reproducibility, implementation and testing of theories and concepts, and multi-modelling synthesis. In general, any contribution advancing ecological modelling is welcome.<br class=\"mb-4\">The ECEM 2023 continues a series of conferences launched by the European chapter of ISEM, the International Society for Ecological Modelling. ISEM promotes the international exchange of ideas, scientific results, and general knowledge in the areas of systems’ analysis and simulations in ecology and application of ecological modelling for natural resource management.<br class=\"mb-4\">Visit website <https://ecem23.eu/>",

The field of ecology has much to offer in addressing pressing ecological problems at all scales. Ecologists working in the private sector (e.g., as consultants, for industry, or in NGOs) and public sector (for resource management agencies or regulatory bodies) are the professionals most responsible for transferring ecological science to effectively manage, conserve, and restore species and ecosystems.<br class=\"mb-4\">The ESA annual meeting provides a tremendous opportunity to engage private- and public-sector ecologists with academic ecologists who generate the science; however, this opportunity has historically largely been missed due to a lack of programming that would attract non-academics.<br class=\"mb-4\">This year’s theme seeks to help create an ESA for All Ecologists by providing programming and inviting sessions that better engage private- and public-sector ecologists by highlighting projects that are implementing ecological science, collaborating across sectors, educating future scientists and decision makers, and disseminating basic and applied ecology research to those who need it most.<br class=\"mb-4\">More information here <https://www.esa.org/portland2023/>",
