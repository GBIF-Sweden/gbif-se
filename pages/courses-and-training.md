The GBIF Secretariat, in collaboration with the GBIF [community of trainers and mentors](https://www.gbif.org/article/5SExsCfj7UaUkMCsuc6Oec/), develops curricula on biodiversity data mobilization and use. These courses are available online for self-paced use or can be adapted for onsite or virtual workshops.

The curriculum includes courses in e.g. [An introduction to GBIF](https://docs.gbif.org/course-introduction-to-gbif/en/), [Biodiversity Data Mobilization](https://docs.gbif.org/course-data-mobilization/en), and [Biodiversity Data Use](https://docs.gbif.org/course-data-use/en/).

More courses and documentation on best practices can be found on the [GBIF pages for training and learning](https://www.gbif.org/training) and on the [SBDI help pages](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/courses-and-training/).
