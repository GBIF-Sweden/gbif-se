The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a free, open source software tool used to publish and share biodiversity datasets through the GBIF network. The Swedish GBIF node is responsible for operating the [national IPT installation](https://www.gbif.se/ipt/) hosted at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. It is possible for organizations to set up additional local IPT installations, but remember that it requires developmental skills and continuous upkeep. 

Contact [gbif@nrm.se](mailto:gbif@nrm.se) or use the [SBDI Support](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/support/) form if you have questions about setting up an IPT or if you would like administrative rights for your organization on the national IPT installation. 

To understand how the IPT works, try watching this concise 25 minute live demo showing how a dataset gets properly published and registered through GBIF.org: [https://youtu.be/eDH9IoTrMVE](https://youtu.be/eDH9IoTrMVE).

Further information, including information on the latest release, downloads, installation, usage, development and translation, is contained in the [IPT User Manual](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/).
