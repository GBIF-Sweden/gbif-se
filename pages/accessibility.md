The GBIF Sweden website is provided by [NRM (Naturhistoriska riksmuseet)](https://www.nrm.se/en/16.html).

We want as many people as possible to be able to use GBIF Sweden’s websites, regardless of platform or any adaptation aids. However, we are aware that the sites have some accessibility problems.

This document describes how gbif.se meets the requirements of the [Act on the Accessibility of Digital Public Services](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility), known accessibility problems, and how you can report deficiencies to us so that we can resolve them.

## Reporting problems with the websites’ accessibility
We constantly work to improve our websites’ accessibility, but are aware of several improvements that can be made. Please let us know if you find issues that are not described below, or if you consider that we do not meet the requirements.

Contact GBIF Sweden if you need information from the web page in any other format, for example accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille.

You can contact us in the following ways:

- Send an email to [gbif@nrm.se](mailto:gbif@nrm.se)
- Use the SBDI [support form](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/support/)

## Supervision
The Agency for Digital Government (DIGG) is responsible for supervision of the Act on the Accessibility of Digital Public Services. If you are not satisfied with our response to your comments or requests, you can [report this to DIGG](https://www.digg.se/en).

## How accessible are the websites?
GBIF Sweden’s website is partially compatible with the Act on the Accessibility of Digital Public Services.

However, since the website is still under construction there are many things that are not yet accessible.

The following content on the websites is not sufficiently accessible:

- Some link texts are too general in their wording and do not describe the destination of the link in sufficient detail.
- On some webpages, the headings are not hierarchically structured.
- Many of our PDFs are not accessible.
- There may be link texts that are not clear enough.
- There may be HTML code that does not fully validate.

## Unreasonably burdensome adjustment
GBIF Sweden invokes exceptions for unreasonably onerous adaptation in accordance with section 12 of the Act on Accessibility to Digital Public Services for the content below.

- Content not covered by the law.
- Tool modules because the function is managed in a separate system.
- Maps not intended for navigation.
- Content produced by users.

According to section 9 of the Act on Accessibility to Digital Public Services, documents published before 2018-09-23 are excluded. This content is available only in exceptional cases.

## How we tested the sites
We regularly review availability both with automated tools and through manual review.

This testing is done by GBIF Sweden staff.

The last major assessment of the website took place in June 2023, when technology, design and structure were constructed and published. Parts of the website have since then undergone minor changes.

## Contact information
Contact [GBIF Sweden](mailto:gbif@nrm.se) or the [SBDI Support Center](https://docs.biodiversitydata.se/support/) if you have questions or comments regarding accessibility.
