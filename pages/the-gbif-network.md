GBIF is an intergovernmental initiative comprising countries, economies, and international organizations. These entities, referred to as "Participants", formally join GBIF by signing the [GBIF Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.gbif.org/mou) (MOU). By doing so, they commit to collaborating and advancing the cause of free and open access to biodiversity data.

Upon joining the [GBIF network](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network), new Participants are encouraged to collaborate within their assigned or chosen regions. Regional meetings, which take place annually or biannually, provide a platform for Participants and their nodes to address shared tasks and issues, establish regional priorities, and foster specialization within the region.

GBIF Sweden is part of the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. To read more about the ECA nodes activities and annual meetings, visit our [GitHub community page](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe). Contact information to other active nodes and organizations within the region can be found at the [regional ECA network page](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network/europe) in the GBIF portal.
