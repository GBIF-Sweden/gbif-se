In partnership with Knowit, GBIF Sweden is participating in a Hyper Island project where four students are exploring the question:

_How can a partnership between Knowit and GBIF Sweden empower Nordic companies to make biodiversity data actionable and drive sustainable decision-making?_

Running from January 9 to February 14, the project aims to develop communication strategies that demonstrate how Knowitâ€™s clients in Scandinavia can utilize biodiversity data services developed by GBIF. A key objective is to support businesses in meeting their reporting obligations under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and, more specifically, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), particularly E4, which focuses on biodiversity and ecosystems.

The students will present their findings at the **Swedish Museum of Natural History (Wickman Hall) on February 14 at 13:00**. Participants are welcome to attend in person or join remotely. Contact [gbif@nrm.se](gbif@nrm.se) to register and get a meeting link.
