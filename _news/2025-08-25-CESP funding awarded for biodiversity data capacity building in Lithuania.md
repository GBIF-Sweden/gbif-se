  GBIF Sweden is pleased to announce that we have been awarded funding from GBIF’s Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) for the project Biodiversity data capacity building in Lithuania.
---
The project will start in 2026 and aims to strengthen national capacity for biodiversity informatics and support the publication and use of open biodiversity data in Lithuania. GBIF Sweden will work closely with three Lithuanian partners:
- Nature Research Centre (Gamtos tyrimų centras)
- Kaunas Tadas Ivanauskas Museum of Zoology
- Vilnius University

The initiative will focus on building skills for mobilizing and managing biodiversity data according to international standards, as well as developing sustainable workflows for data publication through GBIF. It will also foster stronger collaboration between institutions in Lithuania and the broader GBIF community.

Projects funded through the CESP programme play a key role in supporting GBIF participants to develop capacity, share expertise, and promote open data practices worldwide.
