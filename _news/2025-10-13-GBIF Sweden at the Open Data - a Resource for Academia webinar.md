The webinar will highlight how open data from public actors, including research data, can be discovered and used as a strategic resource in research, education, and innovation.

Lena Thöle, Data Steward at GBIF Sweden, will present examples of how biodiversity data published through GBIF can be reused and combined with other open data sources to support research and innovative applications.

The event is open to anyone interested in open data and its reuse within academia. No registration is required, and the webinar will be held mainly in Swedish.
