  A Swedish translation of the policy brief <em>Why countries need the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF): lessons from Belgium</em> is now available. The brief uses Belgium’s long-term engagement in GBIF to show how national participation in a global biodiversity data infrastructure strengthens research, supports policy and management, and enables wide reuse of openly shared species occurrence data.

It highlights the strategic value of contributing to and benefiting from a shared international system for publishing and using biodiversity data, including efficiencies gained through common standards, tools, and coordinated data flows. The Belgian case also illustrates how GBIF-mediated data can support concrete societal needs, such as improved knowledge for biodiversity monitoring and responses to invasive alien species.

The Swedish version provides an accessible entry point for Swedish stakeholders who want a concise overview of GBIF’s national and global relevance.
