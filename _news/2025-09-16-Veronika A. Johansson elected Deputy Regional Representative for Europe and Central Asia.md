In her vision statement, Veronika emphasized the importance of strengthening participation of Nodes across the region, with a particular focus on promoting GBIF within the EU and broadening engagement with new partners. She highlighted the need to support sustainable node resourcing, onboarding, and capacity building, ensuring that Nodes are well equipped to contribute effectively.
