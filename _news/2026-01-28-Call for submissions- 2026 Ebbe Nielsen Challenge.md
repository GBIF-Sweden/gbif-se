The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has opened the call for submissions for the 2026 Ebbe Nielsen Challenge. The challenge promotes innovative uses of open biodiversity data by recognizing the development of tools, workflows, and applications that improve the access, integration, analysis, or reuse of biodiversity information.

The Ebbe Nielsen Challenge is open to individuals and teams worldwide and encourages creative, data-driven solutions that address real-world biodiversity research, policy, or management needs. Submissions are evaluated by an international panel and assessed on their novelty, relevance, technical quality, and potential impact. Winners share a total prize pool of up to USD 20,000.

Participants may submit working prototypes, software tools, data pipelines, or other digital products that make use of GBIF-mediated data, either alone or in combination with other open data sources. Submissions should clearly describe the problem addressed, the approach taken, and the added value of the solution.

The submission deadline is 7 September 2026.

Further details on eligibility, submission requirements, evaluation criteria, and timelines are available from GBIF at:
