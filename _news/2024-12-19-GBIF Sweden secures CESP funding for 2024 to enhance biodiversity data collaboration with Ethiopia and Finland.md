We are pleased to announce that [GBIF Sweden](https://www.gbif.se/) has been awarded funding through the 2024 Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) for the project titled "Building capacity within biodiversity data between Ethiopia and GBIF nodes in Sweden and Finland."
This collaborative initiative, led by GBIF Sweden, brings together partners including [Addis Ababa University](https://www.aau.edu.et/), the [Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute](http://www.ebi.gov.et/), the [Horn of Africa Regional Environment Centre and Network](https://hoarec.org/), GBIF Finland, and Stockholm University. The project aims to enhance biodiversity data management and sharing between Ethiopia, Sweden, and Finland, fostering international cooperation and capacity building within the [GBIF network](https://www.gbif.org/).
CESP is an annual programme that addresses specific capacity needs identified by GBIF Participants, facilitating collaboration at regional and global levels. In the 2024 round, GBIF has awarded more than â‚¬78,000 to fund four projects involving partners across 18 countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. These projects cover a diverse range of topics, including utilizing artificial intelligence for digitizing analog data, implementing interoperable database standards, integrating traditional knowledge into biodiversity data management, and streamlining digitization workflows.
We look forward to the successful implementation of this project and the positive impact it will have on biodiversity data management and collaboration between Ethiopia, Sweden, and Finland.
