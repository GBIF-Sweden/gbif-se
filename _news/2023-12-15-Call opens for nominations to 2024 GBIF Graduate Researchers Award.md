GBIF Sweden is pleased to invite nominations for the [2024 Graduate Researchers Award](https://www.gbif.org/graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to foster and recognize innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master’s and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data.

The 2024 programme will provide a pair of €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers—preferably, one master’s and one PhD candidate—who receive formal nominations from the heads of delegation or node managers of [GBIF Participant countries](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network).

A jury organized by [GBIF Science Committee](https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=scienceCommittee) will select two award recipients from the pool of nominees whose names are received by the GBIF Secretariat by 24 June 2024. The GBIF Secretariat will announce winners before the 31st meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB31) and present the winners' work at the meeting in Portugal in October 2024.

Nominations can come from the GBIF delegation or node of either the candidate's country of citizenship or the country of the candidate’s host institution.
