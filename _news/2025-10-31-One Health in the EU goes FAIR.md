The [European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en) and the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en) have launched the [VectorNet Data Portal](https://www.vectornetdata.org/), providing a central access point to validated European occurrence data for vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, sand flies, and biting midges. The portal leverages GBIF’s hosted portal infrastructure to improve discovery, access, and appropriate reuse of health-related biodiversity data under the FAIR principles.

GBIF Sweden contributes to this effort by assisting with the mobilization and publication of vector datasets to GBIF - including VectorNet materials and additional national and regional sources - to increase findability and interoperability for research and surveillance. This work builds on our ongoing role in hosting and mobilizing vector data and supporting One Health use cases across the GBIF network.
The VectorNet portal aggregates several datasets, including the [VectorNet Observations database](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4abd984b-122c-44a0-8c92-b37e2f5299b1), and already features 14 vector surveillance datasets from EU Member States, with further expansion expected. The collaboration between EFSA, ECDC, and GBIF formalizes data flows that strengthen preparedness for vector-borne diseases and operationalizes recommendations from GBIF’s task group on biodiversity data for human diseases.
