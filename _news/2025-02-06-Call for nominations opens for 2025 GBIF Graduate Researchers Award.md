On behalf of its network of national [Voting and Associate Participants](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network), GBIF Sweden is pleased to invite nominations for the [2025 Graduate Researchers Award](https://www.gbif.org/graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to highlight innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master's and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data.
 
The 2025 programme will provide **two €5,000 prizes** recognizing the work of two early-career researchers. Candidates receive formal nominations from either the national node manager or head of delegation, who generally select one master’s and one PhD candidate whose nominations are then forwarded to the GBIF Secretariat.
 
An expert jury coordinated through GBIF Science Committee will then select two award recipients from the pool of nominees.
The GBIF Secretariat will announce winners prior to the 32nd meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB32), on 18-20 October 2025 in Bogotá, Colombia, and present their work at that meeting.

While the deadline for receipt of nominations at the GBIF Secretariat is 27 June 2025, the **local deadline for nominations from Sweden is 13 June 2025**.

Nominations are to be sent to [gbif@nrm.se](mailto:gbif@nrm.se).
