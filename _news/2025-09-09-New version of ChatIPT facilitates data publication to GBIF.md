A new version of ChatIPT, a chatbot developed by GBIF Norway, is now available for testing. The tool is designed to help non-technical users publish biodiversity data to GBIF, lowering the threshold for researchers, students, and institutions that may not have prior experience with data publishing.

ChatIPT provides an accessible interface for preparing and publishing datasets, handling much of the technical complexity in the background. The latest release introduces several new features, including ORCID login, dataset management, post-publication editing, and improved overall functionality. These additions make it easier for users to maintain control over their datasets and ensure that data can be updated when necessary.

The tool is intended to unlock data that often remain hidden in spreadsheets, contributing to a more complete picture of biodiversity at both national and global levels. By simplifying the publishing process, ChatIPT supports the wider GBIF communityâ€™s goal of increasing data availability and accessibility.

Researchers and data holders are invited to try out the tool and provide feedback to help guide its further development.
