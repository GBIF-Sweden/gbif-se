In collaboration with the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF) and Pensoft Publishers, GBIF has announced a new call for authors to submit and publish data papers on soil biodiversity in a special collection of Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ). The call expands upon the partners’ successful efforts to mobilize data in 2020-2022.

Until 22 September 2023, Pensoft will waive the article processing fee (normally €650) for the first 40 accepted data paper manuscripts that meet the following criteria for describing a dataset:

- with more than 5,000 presence records new to GBIF.org in 2023
- with high-quality data and metadata
- with coverage of species/taxa occurring in soil at least at one stage of their life cycle
