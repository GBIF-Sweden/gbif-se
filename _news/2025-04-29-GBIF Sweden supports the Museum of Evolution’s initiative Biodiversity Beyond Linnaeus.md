GBIF Sweden is pleased to support *Biodiversity Beyond Linnaeus*, an initiative by the Museum of Evolution (Evolutionsmuseet) at Uppsala University to strengthen research, collection care, and public engagement with biodiversity. The project aims to revitalize the museumâ€™s collections, increase their accessibility through digitization, and link them to global infrastructures such as GBIF.

The campaign also invites financial support. Donations will contribute to developing research environments, enhancing public exhibitions, and securing the long-term preservation of valuable scientific collections.

As Veronika Johansson, Node Manager at GBIF Sweden, notes:

*"Every specimen in a collection holds a story about life on Earth. When museums like Evolutionsmuseet digitize and share these stories through GBIF, they become part of a global effort to understand and protect biodiversity. Supporting this work means investing in knowledge that benefits science, conservation, and future generations."*
