The [Ebbe Nielsen Challenge](https://www.gbif.org/ebbe) has opened its 2025 call for innovative tools, both new and existing, that leverage biodiversity data from the GBIF network to advance open science in support of research and policy. An expert jury will judge entries on their relevance, novelty and quality to select a pool of winners to share a prize pool of up to €20,000.

Between now and **7 September 2025**, individuals and teams can submit entries to this open-ended incentive competition, detailing the unique tools and inventive techniques they've developed or improved to increase the accessibility, quality and usefulness of open biodiversity data.

Challenge entries may detail newly developed functional prototypes, tools and techniques or existing ones whose capabilities and features have been improved or extended. Entrants can explore [last year's entries](https://www.gbif.org/news/7cNvqaLzeSyQrLOulk4L5S/2025-ebbe-nielsen-challenge-seeks-innovations-for-open-biodiversity-data#_previous-challenge-entrants) along with [dozens of previous Challenge winners](https://www.gbif.org/composition/6m87h1AVkXkeCUvAApsoQ4/) for inspiration on ideas, topics and approaches worth pursuing.
