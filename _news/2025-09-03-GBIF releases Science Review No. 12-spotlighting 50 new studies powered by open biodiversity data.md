Use of GBIF-mediated data in science continues to grow across both disciplines and geography. In the first three months of 2025 alone, GBIF logged a 27 per cent increase in papers using open biodiversity data compared to the same period the year before.

The newly released GBIF Science Review No. 12 presents summaries of 50 peer-reviewed studies that rely on GBIF-mediated data. Covering an impressive range of topics, these examples represent only a small fraction of the more than six new papers discovered and indexed every single day of the year through GBIF’s literature-tracking programme.

A special feature section focuses on One Health, underscoring how biodiversity information contributes to human and animal health research. The 12 highlighted studies cover issues ranging from mercury poisoning caused by illegal gold mining, to zoonotic mpox and schistosomiasis, and even a clinical investigation into inflammatory bowel disease. These examples illustrate the enduring relevance of One Health approaches in the wake of the global COVID pandemic and beyond.

For Swedish researchers and data publishers working through SBDI/GBIF Sweden, the Science Review provides both inspiration and concrete evidence of the impact of open biodiversity data on advancing discovery, health, and policy worldwide.
