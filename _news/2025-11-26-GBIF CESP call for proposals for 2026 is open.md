The call for proposals for the 2026 GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) is now open. CESP co-funds collaborative projects led by GBIF participant nodes to strengthen capacity for mobilizing, managing, and using biodiversity data across the network.

Participants should submit short concept notes through the GBIF Grants Portal by January 19. Selected teams will be invited to develop full proposals in March, with final decisions expected in late June 2026. 

The program supports activities such as mentoring between nodes, regional training events, and development or translation of guidance and learning resources. Funding requests can be up to 20,000 euros per project and must include collaboration between countries.
