This guide will teach you the principles and approaches of exposing “sequences with dates and coordinates” in the context of broader biodiversity data. The guide covers choices of particular schemas and terms, common pitfalls and good practice, without going into platform-specific details. It will benefit anyone interested in better exposure of DNA-derived data through general biodiversity data platforms, including national biodiversity portals.

Focus is on eDNA and it is synced with OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System).
