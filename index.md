# GBIF Sweden

<p class="text-xl">
GBIF Sweden is the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/country/SE/summary">Swedish participant node</a> in the <a href="https://www.gbif.org">Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF</a>. Our main task is to make primary data on biological diversity from Swedish collections and observation databases freely available and to coordinate and support GBIF-related activities and data use in Sweden.
