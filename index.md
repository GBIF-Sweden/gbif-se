# GBIF Sweden

GBIF Sweden is the [Swedish participant node](https://www.gbif.org/country/SE/summary) in the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF](http://www.gbif.org). Our main task is to make primary data on biological diversity from Swedish collections and observation databases freely available and to coordinate and support GBIF-related activities and data use in Sweden.
